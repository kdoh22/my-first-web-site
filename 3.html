    <P>The <strong><u><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript<a href></a></u></strong>>  (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as <strong><u>JS</P></body>strong></u>, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</P>
